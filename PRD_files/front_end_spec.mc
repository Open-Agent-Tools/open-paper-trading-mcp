# Frontend Architecture Specification

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the recommended architecture for the web frontend of the Open Paper Trading application. The proposed solution is a modern, single-page application (SPA) designed for a high-performance, data-intensive user experience, fully integrated with the existing FastAPI backend and Docker environment.

## 2. Technology Stack

The frontend will be built using the following technologies:

-   **Framework**: **React** (with Vite)
-   **Language**: **TypeScript**
-   **UI Component Library**: **Material-UI (MUI)**
-   **Web Server (Production)**: **Nginx**

## 3. Architecture Rationale

This technology stack was chosen to align with modern web development best practices, ensuring performance, maintainability, and a rapid development cycle.

-   **React with Vite & TypeScript**:
    -   **React** is the industry standard for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces, making it ideal for a complex trading dashboard.
    -   **Vite** provides an exceptionally fast development server with near-instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR), significantly speeding up the development workflow.
    -   **TypeScript** introduces static typing to JavaScript, which aligns with the type-safe design of the FastAPI backend. This helps catch errors during development, improves code quality, and makes the application more robust.

-   **Material-UI (MUI)**:
    -   A trading application is data-heavy and requires a professional, dense user interface.
    -   MUI offers a comprehensive library of pre-built, production-ready components (data grids, charts, forms, navigation elements) that will accelerate development and ensure a consistent, high-quality aesthetic.

-   **Nginx for Production**:
    -   While Vite provides a development server, a dedicated web server is required for production.
    -   **Nginx** is a lightweight, high-performance web server perfect for serving the static files (HTML, CSS, JS) generated by the React build process.
    -   Containerizing Nginx keeps the frontend fully decoupled from the backend API server, which is a production-grade best practice for security and scalability.

## 4. Implementation Plan

The integration will be executed in the following steps:

1.  **Project Structure**: A new `frontend/` directory will be created at the root of the project to contain all frontend-related code and configuration.

2.  **Application Scaffolding**: The React application will be scaffolded inside the `frontend/` directory using `uv run npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts`.

3.  **Dockerization**: A multi-stage `frontend/Dockerfile` will be created:
    -   **Build Stage**: A Node.js image will be used to install dependencies (`npm install`) and build the production-ready static assets (`npm run build`).
    -   **Serve Stage**: A lightweight Nginx image will be used, and the static assets from the build stage will be copied into the Nginx web server directory. This results in a small, optimized final image for deployment.

4.  **Docker Compose Integration**: The `docker-compose.yml` file will be updated to include a new `frontend` service:
    -   It will be configured to build from the `frontend/Dockerfile`.
    -   It will expose port `3000` to the host machine for accessing the web interface.
    -   It will be set to depend on the `app` service, ensuring the backend is available before the frontend starts.

5.  **Backend CORS Configuration**: The FastAPI application in `app/main.py` will be updated with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware to allow web browsers to make requests from the frontend's origin (`http://localhost:3000`) to the backend API.

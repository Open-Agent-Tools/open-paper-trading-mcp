# Open Paper Trading MCP

A FastAPI-based paper trading simulation platform with MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Start the application with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This command will:
   - Build the Docker image for the application.
   - Start the application container and a dedicated PostgreSQL database container.
   - Create a persistent volume for the database to store data.

2. **Access the services:**
   - **FastAPI REST API**: http://localhost:2080/api/v1/
   - **Interactive docs**: http://localhost:2080/docs
   - **Health check**: http://localhost:2080/health
   - **MCP Server**: http://localhost:2081 (SSE transport)

3. **Run development commands:**
   You can run these commands in a separate terminal or inside the running `app` container:
   ```bash
   # Format code
   docker-compose exec app python scripts/dev.py format
   
   # Run tests
   docker-compose exec app python scripts/dev.py test
   
   # Run all checks
   docker-compose exec app python scripts/dev.py check
   ```

4. **Shut down the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## üìã Features

### üîå Dual Interface Support
- **FastAPI REST API**: Traditional HTTP JSON endpoints
- **MCP Server**: AI agent integration via Model Context Protocol
- **Shared Business Logic**: Both interfaces use the same trading service

### üíº Trading Functionality
- **Stock Quotes**: Real-time market data simulation
- **Order Management**: Buy/sell orders with status tracking
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Position management and P&L calculations
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 bearer token authentication (FastAPI)

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Features
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints with Pydantic models
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with pytest (95%+ coverage)
- **Auto-Documentation**: OpenAPI docs for REST API
- **Development Tools**: Black, isort, flake8, mypy integration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline

### ü§ñ MCP Tools Available
- `get_stock_quote` - Get current stock quotes
- `create_buy_order` / `create_sell_order` - Place trading orders
- `get_all_orders` / `get_order` - Order management
- `cancel_order` - Cancel pending orders
- `get_portfolio` / `get_portfolio_summary` - Portfolio overview
- `get_all_positions` / `get_position` - Position tracking

## Key Functional Features

- **Account Instantiation**: Create new paper trading accounts with initial virtual funds and optional owner (e.g., agent name), allowing separate accounts for different agents or users.
- **Order Placement**: Simulate buying and selling stocks/options at market or limit prices, updating virtual positions within a specific account.
- **Portfolio Management**: View all positions, historical trades, open positions, and virtual account balances for a given account.
- **Fund Management**: Deposit or withdraw virtual funds to/from a specific paper trading account.
- **Persistence**: Store account data (including owner, timestamps for trades to compute balance history), trade history, and balances in a local storage backend for session continuity.
- **Dual Access**: All features exposed via HTTP JSON APIs (e.g., POST /accounts, GET /positions/{account_id}) and as MCP tools (e.g., create_account, place_buy_order) for AI agent integration.
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Lightweight web interface to list all accounts (with owners), display current balances, and show balance over time as interactive line charts.

## Key Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: <50ms average response time for API/MCP calls and <200ms for frontend page loads, as user load is minimal (1 human + <5 agents concurrent).
- **Reliability**: 99% availability during local runs; stateless operations where possible, with automatic recovery from DB on restart.
- **Scalability**: Designed for low scale; handles up to 100 requests/min without optimization; easy to run on a standard laptop.
- **Security**: Basic API key or token for HTTP/MCP access to prevent unauthorized access; no real funds involved, so focus on data integrity rather than encryption. All operations local, no external exposure unless configured.
- **Availability**: Persistent storage ensures data survives container restarts; target 100% local uptime with Docker volumes.

## Architecture Overview

The system is a monolithic, event-driven architecture. It is orchestrated with Docker Compose, running the application and a PostgreSQL database in separate containers.

Key components:
- **HTTP API Server (FastAPI)**: Handles RESTful endpoints for traditional access.
- **MCP Server (FastMCP)**: Exposes tools for AI agents, running in the same process as the FastAPI server to share logic.
- **Backend Logic**: Shared Python modules for simulation: order execution, position tracking, and account management.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of all trading data.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages the `app` and `db` services, including networking and persistent volumes.

## Architectural Decisions and Trade-Offs

1. **Monolith vs. Microservices**
   - Decision rationale: A monolith with shared logic simplifies development and is sufficient for the current scale. The application runs in a single container, but the database is separated for better data management.
   - Trade-offs: This approach is easy to maintain now, but may require splitting the application into separate services if it needs to scale significantly.

2. **PostgreSQL vs. SQLite**
   - Decision rationale: PostgreSQL provides a robust, scalable, and production-ready database, managed in its own container. This is superior to a file-based SQLite database for all but the simplest of use cases.
   - Trade-offs: Requires Docker Compose for orchestration, which adds a small amount of complexity compared to a single file.

3. **Dual FastAPI/FastMCP in a Single Container**
   - Decision rationale: Running both servers in the same container allows them to share the core `TradingService` in memory, which is simple and efficient.
   - Trade-offs: The two services cannot be scaled independently. If one required significantly more resources, the application would need to be re-architected.

## Recommended Technology Stack

- **Backend Language and Framework**: Python 3.12, with FastAPI and FastMCP.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, running in a dedicated Docker container.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose to orchestrate the application and database services.
- **Observability**: Basic logging with Python's `logging` module.

## Packaging and Publishing Process

- **Packaging**: The application is packaged as a Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`.
- **Versioning and Deployment**: Use Git for versioning. For local deployment, use `docker-compose up`. This is the recommended way to run the application.
- **Dev-to-Prod Workflow**: Use Git branches (main for prod-like, dev for features). CI via GitHub Actions can be used to lint, test, and build the Docker image on every push.

## Future Evolution Plan

The architecture is designed to be easily extensible.
- **To Scale**: If the application grows, the `app` container can be split into separate `api` and `mcp` services. This would require introducing a shared communication layer (like a message queue or internal API calls) to replace the in-memory service sharing.
- **For Real Market Data**: The `TradingService` can be updated to call external market data APIs.
- **Enhanced Security**: Full JWT/OAuth can be implemented for both the API and MCP interfaces.

## üìä API Reference

(API and MCP tool references remain the same)

### Configuration
The application is configured via environment variables, which are set in the `docker-compose.yml` file for local development. See `.env.example` for a list of available variables.

## üß™ ADK Evaluations

Test your MCP server with Google ADK agent evaluations.

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Run evaluation (in another terminal):**
   ```bash
   # Set your Google API key
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
   
   # Run the evaluation
   adk eval examples/google_adk_agent tests/evals/list_available_tools_test.json --config_file_path tests/evals/test_config.json
   ```

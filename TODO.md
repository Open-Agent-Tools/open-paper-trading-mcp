### Phase 2: Advanced Order Management & Execution
**Goal:** Implement sophisticated order types and execution capabilities for realistic trading simulation.
**Clarification:** This phase introduces stateful, long-running processes. The `OrderExecutionEngine` will be a persistent, background service that operates independently of the API request/response cycle.

#### 2.1 Asynchronous Task Queue
- [ ] Set up Celery with a Redis message broker in `docker-compose.yml`.
- [ ] Create async tasks for order processing and other background jobs.
- [ ] Implement task monitoring and failure handling.
**Clarification:** The task queue is essential for offloading long-running processes like order execution from the main application thread, ensuring API responsiveness.

#### 2.2 Advanced Order Types
- [ ] Update `OrderType` enum in `app/schemas/orders.py` (e.g., stop_loss, stop_limit, trailing_stop).
- [ ] Add trigger fields to the `DBOrder` model (e.g., `stop_price`, `trail_percent`).
- [ ] Implement validation logic for complex order types.
- [ ] Implement MCP tools for specific order types:
    - [ ] `buy_stock_market`, `sell_stock_market`
    - [ ] `buy_stock_limit`, `sell_stock_limit`
    - [ ] `buy_stock_stop_loss`, `sell_stock_stop_loss`
    - [ ] `buy_stock_trailing_stop`, `sell_stock_trailing_stop`
    - [ ] `buy_option_limit`, `sell_option_limit`
    - [ ] `option_credit_spread`, `option_debit_spread`

#### 2.3 Order Execution Engine
- [ ] Build `OrderExecutionEngine` to monitor market data and execute orders when trigger conditions are met.
- [ ] Implement order lifecycle management (pending â†’ triggered â†’ executed).
- [ ] Implement market impact simulation (slippage, partial fills).
- [ ] Create order status tracking and notifications.
- [ ] Implement MCP tools for order management and cancellation:
    - [ ] `stock_orders`, `options_orders`
    - [ ] `open_stock_orders`, `open_option_orders`
    - [ ] `cancel_stock_order_by_id`, `cancel_option_order_by_id`
    - [ ] `cancel_all_stock_orders_tool`, `cancel_all_option_orders_tool`

#### 2.4 Risk Management
- [ ] Implement pre-trade risk analysis and position impact simulation.
- [ ] Add advanced validation for complex order combinations.
- [ ] Calculate portfolio risk metrics (e.g., VaR, exposure limits).

#### 2.5 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for all advanced order types and execution logic.
- [ ] Create performance tests for high-volume order processing.
- [ ] Test edge cases (e.g., market hours, holidays, halted stocks).

### Phase 3: Caching & Performance Infrastructure
**Goal:** Implement Redis caching for scalability and performance.
**Clarification:** The primary goal is to reduce latency for read-heavy operations.

#### 3.1 Redis Caching Layer
- [ ] Set up a dedicated Redis container for caching in `docker-compose.yml`.
- [ ] Implement a `CacheService` using `redis-py` with async support.
- [ ] Integrate the cache into `TradingService` for quotes and portfolio data.

#### 3.2 Caching Strategy & Monitoring
- [ ] Implement TTL-based expiration for cached data.
- [ ] Develop cache invalidation strategies (e.g., on order execution).
- [ ] Add monitoring for cache hit/miss ratios and performance.

### Phase 4: User Authentication & Multi-Tenancy
**Goal:** Implement a secure, production-grade user management and authentication system.
**Clarification:** This is a security-critical phase. Multi-tenancy must ensure strict data isolation between users at the database level.

#### 4.1 User Management & JWT Authentication
- [ ] Create User model and schemas with password hashing (`passlib`).
- [ ] Implement JWT token system with access/refresh token patterns.
- [ ] Implement user registration, profile management, and secure token storage.

#### 4.2 API Security & Multi-Tenancy
- [ ] Secure all relevant FastAPI endpoints with authentication.
- [ ] Implement account isolation and data segregation at the database query level.
- [ ] Add permission-based access control for trading operations.

#### 4.3 Security & Compliance
- [ ] Implement audit logging for all user actions.
- [ ] Add rate limiting, security headers, and CSRF protection.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & User Experience
**Goal:** Enhance the platform with a frontend, advanced tools, and educational features.
**Clarification:** The frontend should be a separate SPA that communicates with the backend via the REST API.

#### 5.1 Frontend Dashboard
- [ ] Develop a React/Vue dashboard with real-time portfolio updates and interactive charts.
- [ ] Create an order management interface supporting advanced order types.

#### 5.2 Advanced MCP Tools
- [ ] Build market analysis tools (e.g., `get_technical_indicators`, `scan_market`).
- [ ] Add options chain analysis and economic news integration.
- [ ] Implement core system tools: `list_tools`, `health_check`.
- [ ] Implement account and portfolio tools: `account_info`, `account_details`.
- [ ] Implement advanced market data tools: `stock_ratings`, `stock_events`, `stock_level2_data`, `market_hours`.
- [ ] Implement advanced options analysis tools: `option_historicals`, `aggregate_option_positions`, `all_option_positions`, `open_option_positions`.

#### 5.3 Educational & Community Features
- [ ] Create interactive trading tutorials and guides.
- [ ] Implement paper trading competitions and leaderboards.
- [ ] Build a strategy sharing and discovery platform.

### Phase 6: Backtesting & Strategy Framework
**Goal:** Build comprehensive strategy development and historical analysis capabilities.
**Clarification:** This phase requires a robust data engineering pipeline for historical data and a backtesting engine that is completely isolated from the live trading service.

#### 6.1 Historical Data Engine
- [ ] Design and implement a time-series data storage solution.
- [ ] Build data ingestion pipelines for historical quote data.

#### 6.2 Backtesting Engine & Strategy Framework
- [ ] Build a backtesting engine with realistic market simulation (slippage, commissions).
- [ ] Create a plugin architecture for custom trading strategies.
- [ ] Implement performance analytics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, max drawdown).
- [ ] Add strategy validation tools (e.g., walk-forward analysis, Monte Carlo simulation).

### Phase 7: Developer Experience & Documentation
**Goal:** Improve the development workflow and provide comprehensive documentation.

#### 7.1 Tooling & Automation
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for automated code quality checks.
- [ ] Implement OpenAPI client generation for easier API consumption.
- [ ] Create CLI administration tools for system management.

#### 7.2 Documentation
- [ ] Create sequence diagrams showing the request flow through the system.
- [ ] Write an API versioning strategy and migration guide.
- [ ] Develop comprehensive deployment and scaling documentation.
- [ ] Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to formalize the development workflow.

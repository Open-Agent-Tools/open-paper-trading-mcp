# Open Paper Trading MCP - Development Roadmap

### Priority 2: Advanced Order Management & Execution
**Goal:** Implement sophisticated order types and execution capabilities for realistic trading simulation.
**Clarification:** This Priority introduces stateful, long-running processes. The `OrderExecutionEngine` will be a persistent, background service that operates independently of the API request/response cycle.

#### 2.1 Background Order Processing
- [ ] Implement background order monitoring within TradingService.
- [ ] Create async order execution loops for processing trigger conditions.
- [ ] Implement order state tracking and failure handling.
**Clarification:** Background processing will be handled directly within the TradingService using asyncio tasks, maintaining the simplified architecture without external message brokers.

#### 2.2 Advanced Order Types
- [ ] Update `OrderType` enum in `app/schemas/orders.py` (e.g., stop_loss, stop_limit, trailing_stop).
- [ ] Add trigger fields to the `DBOrder` model (e.g., `stop_price`, `trail_percent`).
- [ ] Implement validation logic for complex order types.
- [ ] Implement MCP tools for specific order types:
    - [ ] `buy_stock_market`, `sell_stock_market`
    - [ ] `buy_stock_limit`, `sell_stock_limit`
    - [ ] `buy_stock_stop_loss`, `sell_stock_stop_loss`
    - [ ] `buy_stock_trailing_stop`, `sell_stock_trailing_stop`
    - [ ] `buy_option_limit`, `sell_option_limit`
    - [ ] `option_credit_spread`, `option_debit_spread`

#### 2.3 Order Execution Engine
- [ ] Build `OrderExecutionEngine` to monitor market data and execute orders when trigger conditions are met.
- [ ] Implement MCP tools for order management and cancellation:
    - [ ] `stock_orders`, `options_orders`
    - [ ] `open_stock_orders`, `open_option_orders`
    - [ ] `cancel_stock_order_by_id`, `cancel_option_order_by_id`
    - [ ] `cancel_all_stock_orders_tool`, `cancel_all_option_orders_tool`

#### 2.4 Risk Management
- [ ] Implement pre-trade risk analysis and position impact simulation.
- [ ] Add advanced validation for complex order combinations.
- [ ] Calculate portfolio risk metrics (e.g., VaR, exposure limits).

#### 2.5 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for all advanced order types and execution logic.
- [ ] Create performance tests for high-volume order processing.
- [ ] Test edge cases (e.g., market hours, holidays, halted stocks).

### Priority 4: User Authentication & Multi-Tenancy
**Goal:** Implement a secure, production-grade user management and authentication system.
**Clarification:** This is a security-critical phase. Multi-tenancy must ensure strict data isolation between users at the database level.

#### 4.1 User Management & JWT Authentication
- [ ] Create User model and schemas with password hashing (`passlib`).
- [ ] Implement JWT token system with access/refresh token patterns.
- [ ] Implement user registration, profile management, and secure token storage.

#### 4.2 API Security & Multi-Tenancy
- [ ] Secure all relevant FastAPI endpoints with token based authentication.
- [ ] Implement account isolation and data segregation at the database query level.
- [ ] Add permission-based access control for trading operations.

#### 4.3 Security & Compliance
- [ ] Implement audit logging for all user actions.

### Priority 5: Advanced Features & User Experience
**Goal:** Enhance the platform with a frontend, advanced tools, and educational features.
**Clarification:** The frontend should be a separate SPA that communicates with the backend via the REST API.

#### 5.1 Frontend Dashboard
- [ ] Develop a React/Vue dashboard with portfolio(s) status and interactive charts.

#### 5.2 Advanced MCP Tools
- [ ] Build market analysis tools (e.g., `get_technical_indicators`, `scan_market`).
- [ ] Add options chain analysis (**Note:** economic news integration uses external APIs, not deprecated `get_stock_news`).
- [ ] Implement core system tools: `list_tools`, `health_check`.
- [ ] Implement account and portfolio tools: `account_info`, `account_details`.
- [ ] Implement advanced market data tools: `stock_ratings`, `stock_events`, `stock_level2_data`, `market_hours`.
- [ ] Implement advanced options analysis tools: `option_historicals`, `aggregate_option_positions`, `all_option_positions`, `open_option_positions`.


### Priority 7: Developer Experience & Documentation
- [ ] Create sequence diagrams showing the request flow through the system.

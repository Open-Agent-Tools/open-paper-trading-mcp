# Open Paper Trading MCP - Development Roadmap

This document tracks the implementation progress and upcoming tasks for the paper trading simulator with dual REST API and MCP interfaces.

## ðŸ§­ Architectural Strategy
The core principle of this platform is the separation of concerns between the **internal state** and **external data**.

- **Paper Trading System (Internal):** Manages all stateful information, including user accounts, portfolios, positions, orders, and trading history. This is the single source of truth for the user's paper trading activity.
- **Live Data Integration (External):** Provides real-time and historical market data for stocks and options. This data is used to enrich the user's portfolio with live pricing and to provide broad market context. It is read-only and does not affect the internal state.

## âœ… COMPLETED

### Phase 0: Initial Setup & Core Engine
- [x] **Infrastructure:** Docker containerization with PostgreSQL and ADK test runner.

- [x] **Dual-Interface:** Both FastAPI (REST) and FastMCP (AI Agent) servers are operational.

### Phase 1: Codebase Refactoring & Stabilization âœ… [2025-07-16]
**Goal:** Address significant architectural debt and type-safety issues to create a robust, maintainable foundation before adding new features. This involves a full MyPy-driven refactoring to improve data consistency and reduce runtime errors.

**Status:** COMPLETED - A comprehensive, multi-phase refactoring was successfully executed as documented in `REFACTORING_TODO.md`. 

#### Initial Architecture Refactoring:
- MyPy errors reduced from 567 â†’ 271 (-52% improvement)
- Complete schema/model separation with backward compatibility
- Modern SQLAlchemy 2.0 implementation
- Systematic type safety improvements throughout codebase

#### Complete MyPy Resolution [2025-07-16]:
- **Phase 1:** MyPy errors reduced from 97 â†’ 38 errors (-61% reduction)
- **Phase 2:** MyPy errors reduced from 38 â†’ 0 errors (100% resolution)
- **Final Status:** âœ… **0 errors in 72 source files** - 100% MyPy compliance achieved
- **Key Improvements:**
  - Fixed all Pydantic v2 validator type issues
  - Resolved all null safety issues with proper checks
  - Added all missing attributes and methods
  - Fixed all type compatibility issues
  - Installed all required type stubs
  - Achieved complete type safety across entire codebase

## ðŸš€ PLANNED PHASES

### Phase 2: Live Market Data Integration ðŸš§ [In Progress]
**Goal:** Integrate a live, read-only data source (e.g., Robinhood via `open-stocks-mcp`) to provide real-time market context and historical data.

#### 2.1 Foundational Integration
- [ ] **MCP Transport Layer:** Implement the MCP server with an HTTP/SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport to support asynchronous, long-running data lookups for market data tools.
- [ ] **Session Management:** Implement a robust session manager for the live data connection, including authentication and token persistence.
- [ ] **Data Source Abstraction:** Create a clear abstraction layer to cleanly separate live market data queries from internal paper trading data.
- [ ] **Resilience:** Implement consistent error handling, API retries, and rate limiting for the external data source.

#### 2.2 MCP & API Tool Implementation
- [x] **Core Market Data Tools (Live Source):** `get_stock_info`, `get_price_history`, `get_stock_news`, `get_top_movers`, `search_stocks`
- [x] **Core Options Data Tools (Live Source):** `get_options_chains`, `find_tradable_options`, `get_option_market_data`
- [x] **Core API Endpoints:** Market info, history, news, movers, search, options chains, and market data endpoints
- [ ] **Extended Market Data Tools:** `get_top_100`, `get_stocks_by_tag`, `get_stock_earnings`, `get_stock_ratings`
- [ ] **Extended Options Data Tools:** `get_option_historicals`
- [ ] **API Endpoint Completion:** Create corresponding REST endpoints for all new market and options data tools.
- [ ] **Portfolio Integration:** Update existing portfolio and position endpoints to enrich them with live market prices.

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing & Validation
**Goal:** Ensure all existing and newly integrated functionality is robust, correct, and performant through comprehensive testing.

- [ ] **Unit & Integration Testing:**
  - [ ] Write tests for all new live data tools and API endpoints.
  - [ ] Enhance existing tests for the core trading engine (Greeks, order execution, risk management).
  - [ ] Validate all calculations against known financial formulas and reference values.
- [ ] **Monolithic Architecture Validation:**
  - [ ] Test that both FastAPI and MCP servers share the same TradingService instance.
  - [ ] Validate thread safety of shared service between interfaces.
  - [ ] Test concurrent access scenarios (REST + MCP simultaneously).
- [ ] **Service Integration Testing:**
  - [ ] Test data consistency between REST and MCP interfaces.
  - [ ] Validate that changes via one interface are immediately visible in the other.
  - [ ] Test error handling when shared service encounters issues.
- [ ] **Test Data & Scenarios:**
  - [ ] Expand test data to include more diverse scenarios (e.g., earnings, dividends, market volatility).
  - [ ] Create examples and documentation for all major API and MCP workflows.
- [ ] **Performance Testing:**
  - [ ] Benchmark API response times and database query performance under load.
  - [ ] Profile critical components like the Greeks calculator for performance bottlenecks.

### Phase 4: Backtesting Framework
**Goal:** Build a robust framework for strategy development and historical performance analysis.

- [ ] **Historical Data Engine:** Utilize the live data integration to fetch and store historical time-series data efficiently.
- [ ] **Strategy Runner:** Design a plugin architecture to allow for the development and execution of custom trading strategies against historical data.
- [ ] **Performance Analytics:** Implement a suite of backtesting metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, max drawdown, etc.) and reporting tools.
- [ ] **Simulation Realism:** Model realistic market conditions, including bid-ask spreads, slippage, and commissions.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & User Interface
**Goal:** Enhance the platform with a user-facing dashboard and more sophisticated trading tools. This phase will likely be split into sub-projects.

- [ ] **Frontend Dashboard:** Develop a web-based UI (React/Vue) for portfolio visualization, interactive charting, and real-time updates.
- [ ] **Advanced MCP Tools:** Implement tools for more complex analysis, such as `get_market_status`, `get_technical_indicators`, and `scan_market`.
- [ ] **Advanced Risk Management:**
  - [ ] Implement pre-trade risk analysis (order impact simulation).
  - [ ] Add compliance rules like Pattern Day Trader (PDT) tracking.
  - [ ] Introduce position sizing calculators and advanced order types (stop-loss, etc.).

## ðŸ”­ FUTURE VISION

### Phase 6: Educational & Community Features
- [ ] **Interactive Learning:** Create guided trading tutorials, paper trading competitions, and leaderboards.
- [ ] **Collaboration:** Build a strategy-sharing marketplace for users to exchange ideas.

### Phase 7: Production & Enterprise Readiness
- [ ] **Scalability & Observability:** Implement horizontal scaling, database read replicas, and a full observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry).
- [ ] **Enterprise Features:** Add multi-tenancy, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and audit logging.

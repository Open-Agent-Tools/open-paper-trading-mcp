# Open Paper Trading MCP - Development Roadmap

This document tracks the implementation progress and upcoming tasks for the paper trading simulator with dual REST API and MCP interfaces.

## ðŸ§­ Architectural Strategy
The core principle of this platform is the separation of concerns between the **internal state** and **external data**.

- **Paper Trading System (Internal):** Manages all stateful information, including user accounts, portfolios, positions, orders, and trading history. This is the single source of truth for the user's paper trading activity.
- **Live Data Integration (External):** Provides real-time and historical market data for stocks and options. This data is used to enrich the user's portfolio with live pricing and to provide broad market context. It is read-only and does not affect the internal state.

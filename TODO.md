# Open Paper Trading MCP - Development Roadmap

This document tracks the implementation progress and upcoming tasks for the paper trading simulator with dual REST API and MCP interfaces.

## ðŸ§­ Architectural Strategy
The core principle of this platform is the separation of concerns between the **internal state** and **external data**.

- **Paper Trading System (Internal):** Manages all stateful information, including user accounts, portfolios, positions, orders, and trading history. This is the single source of truth for the user's paper trading activity.
- **Live Data Integration (External):** Provides real-time and historical market data for stocks and options. This data is used to enrich the user's portfolio with live pricing and to provide broad market context. It is read-only and does not affect the internal state.

## âœ… COMPLETED PHASES [2025-07-16 to 2025-07-19]

**Phase 0-5 Complete**: Core infrastructure, market data integration, comprehensive testing, and production monitoring

- **Phase 0**: Infrastructure with Docker, PostgreSQL, and dual-interface (FastAPI + MCP)
- **Phase 1**: Complete codebase refactoring with 100% MyPy compliance (567â†’0 errors)
- **Phase 2**: Live market data integration with Robinhood API and comprehensive tooling
- **Phase 3**: Complete testing suite with E2E, integration, and performance validation
- **Phase 4**: Schema-database separation with converter patterns and validation
- **Phase 5**: Production monitoring with health checks, performance benchmarks, and Kubernetes probes

**Key Achievements**: Async architecture, type safety, comprehensive testing, production monitoring, performance targets (<100ms order creation, >95% success rates)

## ðŸš€ UPCOMING PHASES

### Phase 6: Advanced Trading Features
**Goal:** Implement advanced order types and sophisticated trading capabilities.

#### 6.1 Advanced Order Types
- [ ] **Update OrderType enum** in `app/schemas/orders.py` to include `stop_loss`, `stop_limit`, `trailing_stop`
- [ ] **Add trigger fields to DBOrder model** for `stop_price`, `trail_percent`, etc.
- [ ] **Modify OrderExecutionEngine** to handle trigger conditions and convert triggered orders

#### 6.2 Risk Management Enhancements
- [ ] **Pre-trade risk analysis** with order impact simulation
- [ ] **Position sizing calculators** for optimal trade sizing
- [ ] **Advanced validation** for complex order combinations

### Phase 7: Performance & Scalability
**Goal:** Implement caching, async task processing, and scalability improvements.

#### 7.1 Redis Caching Layer
- [ ] **Implement CacheService** using `redis-py` for quotes and portfolio data
- [ ] **Integrate cache into TradingService** for `get_quote` and `get_portfolio` methods
- [ ] **Cache warming strategies** for frequently accessed data

#### 7.2 Asynchronous Task Queue
- [ ] **Set up Celery** with Redis message broker
- [ ] **Create async tasks** for end-of-day reports, corporate actions, backtesting
- [ ] **Refactor existing scripts** to be callable as Celery tasks

### Phase 8: User Authentication & Production Readiness
**Goal:** Implement user management and production-grade security.

#### 8.1 Authentication System
- [ ] **User model and schemas** with password hashing (passlib)
- [ ] **JWT token system** with access/refresh tokens
- [ ] **Secure existing endpoints** with authentication requirements
- [ ] **FastAPI dependencies** for current user injection

#### 8.2 Production Features
- [ ] **Multi-tenancy support** for multiple users
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for permissions
- [ ] **Audit logging** for compliance and monitoring

### Phase 9: Backtesting Framework
**Goal:** Build robust strategy development and historical analysis capabilities.

- [ ] **Historical Data Engine** with efficient time-series storage
- [ ] **Strategy Runner** with plugin architecture for custom strategies
- [ ] **Performance Analytics** (Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, max drawdown, etc.)
- [ ] **Simulation Realism** with bid-ask spreads, slippage, and commissions

### Phase 10: Advanced Features & UI
**Goal:** Enhanced user experience and advanced trading tools.

- [ ] **Frontend Dashboard** (React/Vue) with portfolio visualization and charts
- [ ] **Advanced MCP Tools** for market analysis (`get_technical_indicators`, `scan_market`)
- [ ] **Educational Features** with tutorials, competitions, and leaderboards
- [ ] **Strategy Marketplace** for sharing trading strategies

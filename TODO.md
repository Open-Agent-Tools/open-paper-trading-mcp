# Open Paper Trading MCP - Development Roadmap

## Development Standards
- **Test Coverage**: ≥70% for all new code using `pytest-cov`
- **Code Quality**: Use `python scripts/dev.py check` before commits
- **Type Safety**: All functions must have proper type annotations

## ✅ Recent Completion (2025-01-27)
- **Complete Test Reset**: Removed all 130k+ lines of problematic tests with circular dependencies
- **Database Cleanup**: Cleared all test data from Docker PostgreSQL
- **Project Cleanup**: Fixed pyproject.toml dependencies, removed build artifacts
- **Code Quality**: Fixed critical linting errors, maintained MyPy compliance

## üöß CURRENT PRIORITY

### Phase 2: Architectural & MyPy Refactoring
**Goal**: Address significant architectural and type-safety issues to establish a robust and maintainable foundation before proceeding with new features.

**A comprehensive, multi-phase plan for this effort is documented in `REFACTORING_TODO.md`. This is the next priority and must be completed before work on other phases continues.**

## üöÄ PLANNED PHASES

### Phase 3: Testing, Validation, and Performance
**Goal:** Ensure all migrated and refactored functionality is robust, correct, and performant through comprehensive testing.

#### 3.1 Comprehensive Unit & Integration Tests
- [ ] **Asset Models Testing** (`tests/unit/test_assets.py`): Symbol parsing, factory creation, value calculations, edge cases.
- [ ] **Greeks Calculation Testing** (`tests/unit/test_greeks.py`): Black-Scholes accuracy, IV convergence, edge cases.
- [ ] **Order Execution Testing** (`tests/unit/test_order_execution.py`): Multi-leg logic, position handling (BTO/STO/BTC/STC), FIFO closing.
- [ ] **Risk Management Testing** (`tests/unit/test_risk.py`): Strategy recognition, margin calculation, validation logic.
- [ ] **Database Integration Testing** (`tests/integration/test_database.py`): Persistence, updates, transactions, data integrity.
- [ ] **Reference Validation Testing**: Validate calculations against known reference values and financial formulas.

#### 3.2 Test Data and Examples
- [ ] **Test Data Enhancement** (`app/adapters/test_data.py`): Expand historical data, add diverse scenarios (earnings, dividends), and create stress test datasets.
- [ ] **Educational & API Examples** (`examples/`):
  - Create examples for common options strategies (covered calls, spreads).
  - Document multi-leg order construction and Greeks analysis workflows.
  - Provide usage examples for all FastAPI endpoints and MCP tools.

#### 3.3 Performance and Load Testing
- [ ] **Greeks Calculation Performance**: Benchmark calculation speed and memory usage for large portfolios.
- [ ] **Database Performance**: Optimize queries and test transaction throughput under load.
- [ ] **API Response Times**: Benchmark REST endpoint and MCP tool performance.

### Phase 4: Live Market Data Integration
**Goal:** Integrate real-time market data for a live trading simulation experience.

#### 4.1 Quote Adapter Framework
- [ ] **Base Adapter Interface** (`app/adapters/base.py`): Define a standardized interface for all data providers.
- [ ] **Adapter Registry** (`app/adapters/registry.py`): Implement dynamic, configuration-driven adapter selection with failover.
- [ ] **API Management**: Implement rate limiting, API key management, and error handling for external providers.
- [ ] **Caching Layer** (`app/adapters/cache.py`): Add a Redis-backed cache for quotes to improve performance and reduce API calls.

#### 4.2 Provider Integration
- [ ] **Robinhood/Robin-Stocks Integration** (`app/adapters/robinhood.py`): Implement as the primary provider for stock and options data.
- [ ] **Alternative Data Sources**:
  - **Yahoo Finance**: Implement as a free, key-less backup source.
  - **Alpha Vantage / IEX Cloud**: Plan for integration as alternative paid/institutional sources.

#### 4.3 Data Quality and Management
- [ ] **Data Quality Monitoring**: Implement cross-validation between sources, stale data detection, and price reasonableness checks.
- [ ] **Market Hours and Calendar**: Integrate trading holiday schedules and manage pre/post-market data handling.
- [ ] **Historical Data Management**: Design for efficient storage and backfill capabilities.

### Phase 5: Backtesting Framework
**Goal:** Build a robust framework for strategy development and historical performance analysis.

- [ ] **Historical Data Infrastructure**: Utilize the data integration framework from Phase 3 to set up and manage historical time-series data.
- [ ] **Strategy Engine**: Design a plugin architecture for custom strategies with support for parameter optimization.
- [ ] **Backtesting Analytics**: Calculate comprehensive performance metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, etc.), drawdown analysis, and generate visual reports.
- [ ] **Simulation Quality**: Model realistic market conditions, including bid-ask spreads, slippage, commissions, and corporate actions.

### Phase 6: Advanced Features & UI
**Goal:** Enhance the platform with a user-facing dashboard and more sophisticated trading tools.

- [ ] **Frontend Dashboard**: Create a React/Vue.js SPA for portfolio visualization, interactive charts, and real-time updates via WebSockets.
- [ ] **Advanced MCP Tools**:
  - `get_market_status`, `get_technical_indicators`, `search_symbols`, `get_news_sentiment`, `set_price_alert`, `scan_market`.
- [ ] **Advanced Risk Management & Analytics**:
  - [ ] **Pre-Trade Risk Analysis**: Implement order impact simulation (cash, margin, Greeks) and checks for position concentration and liquidity.
  - [ ] **Strategy-Based Validation**: Enforce correct leg ratios for standard strategies and implement strategy-specific capital limits.
  - [ ] **Market-Aware Validation**: Validate limit prices against the current market and reject orders outside of trading hours.
  - [ ] **Compliance Rules (Future)**: Implement Pattern Day Trader (PDT) tracking, options approval level checks, and wash sale rule detection.
  - [ ] Implement position sizing calculators (e.g., Kelly criterion), stop-loss/take-profit orders, and VaR calculations.
- [ ] **Machine Learning Integration**: Add pipelines for price prediction, sentiment analysis, and anomaly detection.

### Phase 7: Educational & Community
**Goal:** Build features to support learning, collaboration, and research.

- [ ] **Educational Platform**: Create interactive trading tutorials, guided lessons, and achievement systems.
- [ ] **Community Features**: Implement paper trading competitions, leaderboards, and a strategy-sharing marketplace.
- [ ] **Research & Academic Tools**: Add data export capabilities and statistical testing frameworks for academic use.

## üè¢ FUTURE

### Phase 8: Production & Enterprise
**Goal:** Prepare the platform for high-availability, multi-tenant, and enterprise use cases.

- [ ] **Performance & Scaling**: Implement database read replicas, horizontal scaling, and load test for 1000+ concurrent users.
- [ ] **Observability**: Set up Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), and Grafana dashboards.
- [ ] **Enterprise Features**: Add multi-tenant architecture, RBAC, audit logging, and SSO integration.
- [ ] **Global Markets**: Introduce support for multiple currencies and asset classes (Forex, Crypto).
